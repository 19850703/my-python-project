Objective: 
Developing a machine learning model that: 

•	Predict stock price movement based on: 

o	Historical data. 

o	Financial statements.

o	Technical indicators.

•	Generate buy / sell signals to assist trading decisions. 

•	Continuously updates in a real time to update to market conditions. 

==> Output: A trading system that suggests BUY or SELL stocks based on a predictive model.

We will use following steps: 

Step 1: Data Collection:
•	Real-Time Market Data (Technical Analysis)
o	Stock Prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).
o	Technical Indicators:

	Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)

	Relative Strength Index (RSI)

	MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

	Bollinger Bands

o	Sentiment Data: 

	News Sentiment from financial articles.

	Social Media Sentiment (Twitter, Reddit, etc.).

•	Financial Statements (Fundamental Analysis)
o	Income Statement: Revenue, Net Income, Earnings Per Share (EPS).
o	Balance Sheet: Assets, Liabilities, Shareholder Equity.
o	Cash Flow Statement: Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow.
o	Financial Ratios:
	Price-to-Earnings (P/E), Price-to-Book (P/B).
	Debt-to-Equity (D/E), Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE).
	Data Sources:
•	Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)
•	Alpha Vantage API
•	SEC Filings (EDGAR API)
•	Quandl (Premium Financial Data)

Step 2: Feature Engineering
Creating new features from raw data: 

•	Time-Series Features (Technical Indicators)
o	Compute SMA (50-day, 200-day) to identify trends.
o	Calculate RSI to detect overbought/oversold stocks.
o	Compute MACD to find bullish/bearish momentum.
o	Use Bollinger Bands to analyse price volatility.

•	Financial Ratios (Fundamental Features)
o	Normalize financial ratios (log transformations for large values).
o	Compute growth rates:
	Revenue YoY Growth
	EPS Growth
	Cash Flow Growth
o	Compare stock financials with industry benchmarks.

•	Sentiment Analysis: 
o	Convert financial news into sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative).
o	Use NLP models (BERT, LSTM) for sentiment classification.

Step 3: Model Selection: (making predictions) 

Define the Problem Type:
•	Regression (Predict future price).
•	Classification (Predict buy/sell movement).

We need a ‘hybrid approach’ that combines both technical & fundamental analysis.
We will use Ensemble Learning (Combining Machine Learning and Deep Learning). 
Following will be used: 
o	XGBoost (Short-term trend detection)
o	LSTM (Long-term forecasting)
o	Sentiment Analysis (To analyse financial news & social media)
o	Meta-Learning (Stacking both models for better accuracy)


Step 4: Decision-Making Strategy (Buy/Sell Logic): (trading strategy)

•	Signal-Based Trading: 

o	BUY Signal:
	Price Prediction > Current Price by X%.
	RSI < 30 (Oversold Condition).
	Financial Strength Indicators are Positive (High EPS Growth, Low Debt).
o	SELL Signal:
	Price Prediction < Current Price by Y%.
	RSI > 70 (Overbought Condition).
	Fundamentals Show Overvaluation (High P/E, Low Earnings Growth).

•	Risk Management

o	Stop-Loss: Sell if the stock drops 3% below purchase price.
o	Take-Profit: Sell if the stock rises 5% above purchase price.


Step 5: Implementation

•	Real-Time Data Pipeline
o	Fetch stock data every minute/hour.
o	Update financial statement data quarterly.

•	Automated Trade Execution
o	Use Broker APIs (Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, Binance, etc.).
o	Execute buy/sell orders automatically.

•	Monitor Model Performance:
o	Track prediction accuracy in real time.
o	Adjust decision-making thresholds based on live market conditions.

Step 6: Model Evaluation: (Validate model accuracy & measure uncertainty)

•	Apply Bootstrap Resampling:
o	Resample the dataset with replacement (e.g., 1,000 times).
o	Train the model on each resampled dataset.

•	Compute Performance Metrics:
o	Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
o	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
o	Classification Accuracy (For Buy/Sell predictions).

•	Calculate Confidence Intervals:
o	Use bootstrap results to compute 95% confidence interval.
o	Determine model uncertainty in predictions.

•	Visualize Model Performance:
o	Plot error distribution using histograms.
o	Show confidence interval bands on the price prediction graph
